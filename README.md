# Socket-Programming-BST
# Introduction
Implementation for the Binary Search Tree(BST) visual representation with the help of socket programming. 
Inputs will be given from the n number of clients to the server which will update BST.
# Usage
For running server-> $ python server-bst.py           
For running n number of clients -> $ python client-call.py

# Configuration
[attributes]                  
no_of_clients = 5  -> number of clients which needs to be communicate to server        
no_of_numbers = 20 -> number of number which needs to be send from client to server

# Output
Please find the different types of configurations and corresponding Output files:

no_of_clients = 5         
no_of_numbers = 20       

no_of_clients = 5               
no_of_numbers = 15            

no_of_clients = 7               
no_of_numbers = 10
